# Socket Programming Application

This project is a simple socket programming application that demonstrates client-server communication using Python's socket library. The application consists of a client that connects to a server, sends user input, and receives responses.

## Project Structure

```
socket-program-app
├── src
│   ├── client.py       # Client-side implementation
│   └── server.py       # Server-side implementation (not provided)
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd socket-program-app
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (if any):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
   - Implement the server-side logic in `src/server.py`.
   - Run the server script:
     ```
     python src/server.py
     ```

2. Run the client:
   - Execute the client script:
     ```
     python src/client.py
     ```

3. Follow the prompts in the client to send messages to the server and receive responses.
